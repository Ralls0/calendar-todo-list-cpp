CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /Users/rallso/Dropbox (Politecnico Di Torino Studenti)/Git/calendar-todo-list-cpp/cmake-build-debug/config.tests/static_link_order/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /Users/rallso/CLionProjects/QtNetWOAuth2/cmake-build-debug/config.tests/static_link_order where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
